# Utilities

I made this for (mostly) my use so I didn't have to use anything else, and I could have absolute control over the functions.

## The Calculator

[The calculator](https://pixelxii.github.io/Utilities/math/ccalc.html) can add, subtract, multiply, divide, return random numbers, and convert to percents. There is a [grades calculator](https://pixelxii.github.io/Utilities/grades.html) that tells you how many points each question is worth on a test. There will be more coming to that soon!
